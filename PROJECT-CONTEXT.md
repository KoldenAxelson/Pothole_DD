# Project Context

## Background
I'm preparing for an interview with a company that builds an AI-driven insurance system for analyzing windshield damage through images. Their tech stack includes:
- React with Remix
- PostgreSQL
- AWS (Lambda, Step Functions, S3)
- AI/ML for image analysis

## My Approach
I'm building a similar system that demonstrates my understanding of their stack and problems, but focused on pothole detection from dashcam footage. I chose this because:

1. Similar Technical Challenges:
   - Image analysis
   - Damage detection
   - Confidence scoring
   - False positive/negative handling

2. Available Data:
   - RDDC (Road Damage Detection Challenge) dataset
   - Mapillary Vistas Dataset
   - Public dashcam footage

3. Matching Architecture:
   - Frontend: React + Remix
   - Database: PostgreSQL
   - Cloud: AWS Serverless
   - ML Pipeline: Similar to their windshield analysis

## Current Progress
I'm in the initial setup phase:
1. Repository initialized
2. Basic structure planned
3. [Add any other progress points here]

## Request for Claude
I need assistance with:
1. Technical decisions for each stage of development
2. Best practices for implementing their stack
3. Suggestions for demonstrating relevant skills
4. Code review and optimization
5. Architecture decisions that align with their needs

Please refer to the attached README.md for the full project plan and progress checklist.

## Company's Original Job Requirements and Stack
Their system:
- Analyzes car insurance claims for windshield damage
- Uses custom trained AI to scan images
- Web app built with React, Remix, PostgreSQL, AWS
- Uses serverless lambdas and step functions
- Requires strong understanding of ML model performance and error rates

## Key Points to Demonstrate
1. Full-stack capabilities
2. ML/AI integration expertise
3. AWS serverless architecture knowledge
4. Database optimization
5. Error handling and performance monitoring

Please help me make decisions and implement features that would impress in the interview by showing I understand their technical challenges and can solve similar problems.
